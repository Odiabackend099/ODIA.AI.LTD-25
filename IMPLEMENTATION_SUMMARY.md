# ODIADEV Voice AI - Ultra-Low Latency Streaming Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of ultra-low latency streaming features for the ODIADEV Voice AI chat widget, including voice activity detection, interruption handling, true streaming pipeline with overlapping processing, and pre-generated response buffering.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Ultra-Low Latency Streaming
The implementation uses Groq's streaming API with the `llama-3.1-8b-instant` model to achieve ultra-low latency responses:

- **Streaming Endpoint**: `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions` with `stream: true`
- **Chunked Processing**: Real-time processing of response chunks as they arrive
- **Immediate Display**: Streaming response is displayed to user immediately as tokens are received
- **Optimized Model**: Uses Groq's LPU for sub-200ms inference times

### 2. Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
Voice Activity Detection is implemented using Web Audio API to automatically stop listening when the user finishes speaking:

- **Audio Context**: Creates AudioContext to analyze microphone input
- **Analyser Node**: Uses createAnalyser() to process audio frequency data
- **Volume Detection**: Calculates average volume to detect speech vs. silence
- **Silence Timer**: Automatically stops listening after 1.5 seconds of silence
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors audio with requestAnimationFrame

### 3. Interruption Handling
The system supports interruption of both speech recognition and speech synthesis:

- **AbortController**: Uses AbortController for canceling ongoing API requests
- **Speech Interruption**: Stops ongoing TTS playback when user interrupts
- **Request Cancellation**: Cancels active Groq streaming requests
- **Audio Queue Clearing**: Clears pending audio segments when interrupted
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows interruption state to user

### 4. True Streaming Pipeline with Overlapping Processing
The implementation creates a true streaming pipeline with overlapping processing:

- **Parallel Processing**: Processes incoming tokens while generating TTS for previous segments
- **Response Buffering**: Buffers response chunks in `responseBufferRef`
- **Audio Queuing**: Queues generated audio URLs in `currentAudioQueueRef`
- **Concurrent Operations**: Streams LLM response while simultaneously processing TTS
- **Asynchronous Handling**: Uses async/await for proper sequencing

### 5. Pre-generated Response Buffering
The system buffers responses to optimize TTS generation and playback:

- **Chunk Buffering**: Stores response chunks in `responseBufferRef`
- **Segment Detection**: Triggers TTS generation at sentence boundaries or length thresholds
- **Accumulated Response**: Builds complete sentences before TTS generation
- **Threshold Management**: Generates TTS after 50 characters or sentence endings
- **Efficient Playback**: Queues audio segments for smooth playback

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **StreamGroqResponse Function**
   - Handles streaming connection to Groq API
   - Processes Server-Sent Events (SSE) in real-time
   - Buffers response content for TTS generation
   - Manages AbortController for request cancellation

2. **Voice Activity Detection System**
   - Initializes AudioContext and analyser
   - Monitors microphone input in real-time
   - Detects voice activity vs. silence
   - Automatically stops listening after silence duration

3. **TTS Generation and Playback**
   - Generates speech using Minimax TTS API
   - Queues audio URLs for sequential playback
   - Handles audio playback completion and errors
   - Supports interruption and cancellation

4. **Interruption Management**
   - Provides user interrupt capability
   - Cancels ongoing operations cleanly
   - Resets system state appropriately
   - Maintains responsive UI during interruptions

### Performance Optimizations

- **Low Latency Target**: Sub-250ms end-to-end latency
- **3G Optimization**: Works efficiently on limited bandwidth
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of audio resources
- **Memory Efficiency**: Efficient buffering and queuing systems
- **Responsive UI**: Non-blocking operations with proper state management

## Testing Results

All requested features have been successfully implemented and verified:

✅ Ultra-low latency streaming with Groq API
✅ Voice activity detection with automatic silence detection
✅ Interruption handling with AbortController
✅ True streaming pipeline with overlapping processing
✅ Pre-generated response buffering

## Usage

The implementation is ready for production use with the following configuration:

1. Set Groq API key in `window.ODIA_WIDGET.groqApiKey`
2. Set Minimax API key in `window.ODIA_WIDGET.minimaxApiKey`
3. Set Minimax Group ID in `window.ODIA_WIDGET.minimaxGroupId`
4. Optional: Configure voice, theme, and other settings

## Conclusion

The ODIADEV Voice AI chat widget now provides a complete ultra-low latency voice interaction experience with all the requested features implemented according to specifications. The system is optimized for Nigerian English and provides a seamless voice-to-voice conversation experience with sub-250ms latency targets.
