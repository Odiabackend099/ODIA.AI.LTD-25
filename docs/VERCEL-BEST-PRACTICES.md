# Vercel Deployment Best Practices for ODIADEV AI

This document outlines the best practices implemented for deploying ODIADEV AI applications to Vercel.

## 1. Project Structure

### Monorepo Organization
- Separate directories for each application:
  - `odiadev-admin-dashboard/`
  - `odiadev-chat-widget/`
- Shared documentation in `docs/` directory
- Root-level configuration for monorepo deployment

### Framework Detection
- Vercel automatically detects Vite framework
- Explicit configuration in `vercel.json` for consistency

## 2. Configuration Files

### Project-Level Configuration
Each project includes a `vercel.json` file with:
- Build command specification
- Output directory configuration
- Install command optimization
- Rewrite rules for SPA routing
- Health check endpoint routing

### Root-Level Configuration
- Monorepo configuration for deploying multiple projects
- Route handling for different applications
- GitHub integration settings

## 3. Build Optimization

### Dependency Management
- Using `pnpm` for efficient dependency installation
- `--prefer-offline` flag to speed up builds
- Clean build process with temporary file removal

### Build Commands
- Explicit build commands in configuration
- TypeScript compilation before Vite build
- Production mode flag for optimized builds

## 4. Routing and SPA Support

### Rewrite Rules
- Catch-all rewrite rules for client-side routing
- Specific routes for API endpoints
- Health check endpoint routing

### Static Asset Serving
- Proper configuration for `dist/` directory
- Asset optimization through Vite build process

## 5. Health Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoints
- `/api/health` endpoint for each application
- JSON response with service status and metadata
- Timestamp for deployment verification

### Status Information
- Service identification
- Version tracking
- Timestamp for uptime monitoring

## 6. Environment Variables

### Secure Configuration
- Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
- No sensitive data in source code
- Proper separation of development and production configs

### Required Variables
- Supabase connection details
- API endpoints for backend services
- Feature flags for different environments

## 7. Performance Optimization

### Build Caching
- Dependency caching through pnpm
- Vercel's build cache for faster subsequent builds
- Output directory optimization

### Asset Optimization
- Vite's built-in optimization
- Minification and compression
- Efficient bundling strategies

## 8. Deployment Strategies

### Preview Deployments
- Automatic preview deployments for pull requests
- Isolated environments for testing
- Quick feedback loop for changes

### Production Deployments
- Manual promotion from preview
- Custom domain support
- SSL certificate management

## 9. Monitoring and Analytics

### Vercel Analytics
- Performance monitoring
- Usage analytics
- Error tracking

### Custom Monitoring
- Health check endpoints
- Application-specific metrics
- Integration with external monitoring tools

## 10. Security Best Practices

### Access Control
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secure API key management
- Proper CORS configuration

### Deployment Security
- Verified GitHub integration
- Protected branch deployments
- Review app security

## 11. Scalability Considerations

### Edge Network
- Global CDN distribution
- Edge function optimization
- Regional deployment strategies

### Resource Management
- Efficient build processes
- Optimized asset delivery
- Caching strategies

## 12. Maintenance

### Automated Updates
- Dependency update strategies
- Framework version management
- Security patch deployment

### Documentation
- Clear deployment instructions
- Troubleshooting guides
- Configuration documentation
